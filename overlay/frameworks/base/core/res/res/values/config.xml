         A high value will cause the lowmemorykiller to fire earlier, keeping more memory
         in the file cache and preventing I/O thrashing, but allowing fewer processes to
         stay in memory.  A low value will keep more processes in memory but may cause
         thrashing if set too low.  Overrides the default value chosen by ActivityManager
         based on screen size and total memory for the largest lowmemorykiller bucket, and
         scaled proportionally to the smaller buckets.  -1 keeps the default. -->
